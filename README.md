# What-is-CSS

Cascading Style Sheets, or CSS, are the building blocks of web design. It 
takes simple HTML designs and turns them into websites that look great. It's a 
language that lets designers and web developers control how HTML parts look.

HTML is like the framework of a website; it holds all the text blocks together. CSS is the 
stylish clothes, makeup, and general look of a webpage that makes it come to life. When you use CSS, you can:

Fonts and Colours: You can change the font, size, and colour of text.

Layout: Make designs with more than one column, put parts exactly where you want them, 
and make layouts that work on any screen size.

Backgrounds: Put pictures or colours in the background.
Animations and Transitions: Make smooth visual effects to make it easier for users to connect with your site.

Add Interactive Elements: To keep your guests interested and happy, use animations, smooth transitions, and subtle shadows.
CSS makes websites look good and is easy for people to use. Its main benefit is that it
keeps text (HTML) and presentation (CSS) separate. This means that you can change the styles of a whole
website with not many changes to the code.  This efficiency saves time and makes it easy to keep up with website upkeep.

To put it simply, CSS paints the walls, decorates the rooms, and makes the house a nice place to live.
